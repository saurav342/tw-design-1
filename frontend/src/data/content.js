  {
    question: 'What stages does Launch & Lift support?',
    answer: 'We partner with founders from seed through Series A, with select support for pre-seed and Series B extensions. Our AI-powered matching engine works best for startups that have achieved product-market fit or have strong early traction, but we also support exceptional pre-revenue teams with compelling validation and market opportunity.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the AI-powered matching work?',
    answer: 'Our proprietary matching engine analyzes 100+ data signals including founder background, market opportunity, business model, growth trajectory, team composition, investment stage, and investor thesis alignment. Machine learning models assess compatibility probability and surface high-probability matches that would be missed through manual research. We evaluate factors like founder experience, execution capability, network strength, market understanding, and resilience to create the most accurate matches possible.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does the process take?',
    answer: 'Most founders move from onboarding to closed funding within 8–16 weeks, depending on round size and complexity. The process typically includes 1-2 weeks for profile creation and pitch optimization, 2-4 weeks for investor matching and introductions, and 4-10 weeks for investor conversations, due diligence, and closing. Our AI-powered matching reduces time-to-qualified-investor-conversation from weeks to days compared to traditional cold outreach.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is your success rate?',
    answer: '87% of teams that complete our full program secure term sheets, with the majority closing above target. Founders using our platform see 3-5x higher conversion rates compared to cold outreach (which averages <10% response rates). The key is our intelligent matching, which ensures you only spend time with investors who are actively deploying capital in your stage, sector, and geography.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do investor introductions work?',
    answer: 'We shortlist aligned investors based on our AI matching analysis, provide warm context about your startup and why it fits their thesis, and prepare you for each conversation with tailored briefs covering investor background, investment patterns, and conversation topics. Unlike cold outreach, our warm introductions command significantly higher response rates because investors trust our curation and understand the relevance before the first conversation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does it cost?',
    answer: 'We offer flexible pricing models to align with your stage and needs. Our freemium model provides basic matching at no cost. Premium tiers ($49-199/month) include advanced features like pitch deck analysis, founder profiling, warm introductions, and priority support. For our success-fee program, we charge an upfront engagement fee (₹2-3L) to assemble your deal squad, with a success fee applied only on capital actually closed. This ensures our incentives stay perfectly aligned with your outcomes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I do not raise funding?',
    answer: 'Your upfront investment covers program delivery and ensures we stay committed to your success; our performance fee is only triggered when you close. For premium subscriptions, you pay monthly for access to our platform and services regardless of outcome. For our success-fee program, if you don\'t raise, you only pay the engagement fee—no success fee is charged. We\'re committed to your success and work hard to ensure positive outcomes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you take equity?',
    answer: 'No. We operate on fees tied to outcomes, so your cap table stays intact. We believe in keeping founders\' equity ownership maximized while providing the support and connections needed to raise capital successfully. Our business model is built on subscription fees and success-based compensation, not equity dilution.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What services are included in the platform?',
    answer: 'Launch & Lift provides four core services: (1) AI-powered investor matching with warm introductions, (2) comprehensive founder profiling and assessment with actionable insights, (3) pitch deck refinement and optimization with real-time AI feedback, and (4) integrated business services including legal compliance, technical solutions, growth marketing, and operational support. All services are accessible through one unified platform, eliminating the need to coordinate with multiple vendors.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you help with pitch deck creation?',
    answer: 'Yes—our pitch studio co-builds your deck, data room, and financial models with feedback loops baked in. We provide AI-powered analysis comparing your pitch against investor expectations and successful funding benchmarks, real-time feedback on market validation and narrative coherence, design optimization recommendations, and financial projection analysis. Our goal is to help you reach investor-quality standards 70% faster than traditional methods.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need traction to use the platform?',
    answer: 'Traction helps, but we also work with pre-revenue teams that have strong validation and a credible path to market. Our AI matching considers multiple factors beyond revenue, including founder experience, market opportunity, product validation, team strength, and business model clarity. If you have compelling validation, a clear value proposition, and a credible path to market, we can help connect you with the right investors.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What makes Launch & Lift different from other platforms?',
    answer: 'We\'re the only platform combining intelligent matching + comprehensive founder profiling + AI-powered pitch optimization + integrated business services. Rather than coordinating separately with lawyers, developers, and marketers, everything you need is available through one platform with data-backed insights. Our AI analyzes 100+ signals to surface matches that would be impossible to find manually, and our integrated services eliminate the 60-80 hours typically wasted on vendor coordination.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you provide actual funding?',
    answer: 'Launch & Lift connects you with aligned investors—from angel investors to institutional VCs—who are actively deploying capital. We facilitate the matching and provide support services, but the actual investment comes from our network of investors who use our platform to source quality deal flow. We help you prepare, match, and connect, but investors make their own independent investment decisions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What geographic regions do you cover?',
    answer: 'We primarily serve founders and investors in India and are expanding to select global markets including the US, EU, and APAC regions. Our platform supports remote collaboration, so founders and investors can connect regardless of location. However, our strongest network and service coverage is currently in India, where we have deep relationships with 300+ mapped investors and a robust ecosystem of service providers.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you ensure investor quality and alignment?',
    answer: 'We maintain a curated network of 300+ investors who are actively deploying capital. Each investor profile includes their investment thesis, stage focus, sector expertise, geographic preference, ticket size, and past investment patterns. Our AI matching engine analyzes these factors along with your startup profile to surface only the most relevant, high-probability matches. We also track investor activity and engagement to ensure our network consists of active, responsive capital partners.',
